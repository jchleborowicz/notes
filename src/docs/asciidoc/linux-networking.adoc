= Linux networking

== Basics

MAC Address::
    Unique fingerprint of the network interface.

IP Address::
    Unique address on the network.

Subnet::
    Separates the IP into network and host addresses.

Gateway::
    The connection leading outside of the local network.

DNS Host::
    Translates hostname into IP addresses.

DNS Domain::
    The lookup domain for the host.

Checking IP address:

[source,bash]
----
$ ifconfig
$ ip addr
$ nmcli
$ nmcli device show
$ ip route show
$ routel
----

== Network topology

=== Switching

switch::
    forwards packets within internal network

router::
    forwards packets between networks

=== OSI Layers

OSI model::
    Open Systems Interconnection model.
    Partitions a communication system into abstraction layers.

.Classes and subnets:

* Class A - 255.0.0.0
* Class B - 255.255.0.0
* Class C - 255.255.255.0

.Private networks:

* Class A - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
* Class B - 172.16.0.0 _ 172.31.255.255
* Class C - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

Loopback range - 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255

CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing

Subnets in IPv6:

* 128 bits - whole address
* first 64 bits - network address
    ** first 48 bits - global network address
    ** last 16 bits - internal network address
* last 64 bits - MAC address

Types of IPv6 address:

* global unicast - Internet scope - routed on Internet `2001:`
* unique local - internal network scope - not routed on internet
* link local - network link scope - not routed on Internet - `FE80:`

NAT::
    Network address translation is a method of **remapping** one IP address space into another
    by modifying network address information on the IP header of packets while they are
    in transit across a traffic routing device.

== Routing

.Router
* **layer 3** device, functioning at the IP level
* forwards data between networks
* the routing table is a **static table** mapping of the best path to a network destination

Example:

[pre]
----
Kernel IP routing table:
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   Metric  Ref Use Iface
0.0.0.0         172.31.96.1     0.0.0.0         UG      100     0   0   eth0
172.31.96.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U       100     0   0   eth0
----

Flags:

* U - up
* G - gateway

Rules:

* if the destination is outside of the local network, use the gateway
* if the destination is inside the local network, don't use the gateway

Static routes:

* manually configured routes
* for traffic that must not go through the default gateway

.BGP
* Border Gateway Protocol
* routing protocol used to route traffic across the internet
* layer 4 protocol sitting on top of TCP - this makes it simpler than OSPF,
  as it doesn't manage what TCP handles
* there is no discovery - peer that have been manually configured
  to exchange routing information for a TCP connection
* organizations can use BGP for true multi-homing their corporate network
* an **ASN** (Autonomous System Number) is required to implement BGP peering
    ** this is a special number assigned by IANA for use primarily with BGP that identifies
       each network on the internet
* two routers that have established a connection and exchanged BGP information
  are **BGP peers**, exchanging routing information between them via BGP sessions over TCP
