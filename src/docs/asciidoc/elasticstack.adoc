== Basics

Compontents:

* Core Services:
    ** Elasticsearch
    ** Logstash
    ** Kibana
    ** Beats
* X-Pack:
    ** Security
    ** Alerting
    ** Monitoring
    ** Reporting
    ** Graph
    ** Machine Learning
* Elastic Cloud
* Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE)

Purpose:

* monitoring

Flow:

. Web Access log
. *Filebeat* - Web Aspect Prospector
. *Logstash* - Web Access Pipeline
. **Elastisearch cluster**
. *Kibana* - search and visualisation

=== Beats

Beat types:

* Filebeat
    ** multiline
    ** include/exclude filters
    ** backpressure tolerant
    ** container ready
* Metricbeat
    ** one client, many modules (ex. system, docker, mongodb, kubernetes,
       nginx, mysql, postgresql)
    ** container ready
* Packetbeat
    ** decodes network protocols (icmp, dns, http, amqp, cassandra, mysql, postgresq,
       thrift-rpc, mongodb, memcache, tls)
    ** correlates requests with responses
* Heartbeat
    ** pings via icmp, tcp and http
    ** supports tls, authentication and proxies
    ** simple dns resolution
* Winlogbeat
    ** attach to windows event log channels
* Auditbeat
    ** auditd module:
        *** linux only
        *** attaches to linux kernel's audit framework
        *** combines multiple audit messages into a single event
        *** configure what syscalls to monitor
    ** file integrity module:
        *** compatible with linux, macos, windows
        *** hashes specified files and monitors changes in real-time
        *** compare to known malicious file hashes

Libbeat - common library, foundation of every beat

=== Logstash

Designed for log processing.

Data pipelines:

* inputs - ingest from multiple sources
* filters - parse events into structured fields, enrich events dynamically.
* outputs - stash the processed events, output to multiple destinations
