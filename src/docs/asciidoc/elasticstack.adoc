    .. Elasticsearch
    .. Logstash
    .. Kibana
    .. Beats
. X-Pack:
    .. Security
    .. Alerting
    .. Monitoring
    .. Reporting
    .. Graph
    .. Machine Learning
. Elastic Cloud
. Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE)

Purpose:

* monitoring

Flow:

. Web Access log
. *Filebeat* - Web Aspect Prospector
. *Logstash* - Web Access Pipeline
. **Elastisearch cluster**
. *Kibana* - search and visualisation

=== Beats

Beat types:

. Filebeat
    .. multiline
    .. include/exclude filters
    .. backpressure tolerant
    .. container ready
. Metricbeat
    .. one client, many modules (ex. system, docker, mongodb, kubernetes,
       nginx, mysql, postgresql)
    .. container ready
. Packetbeat
    .. decodes network protocols (icmp, dns, http, amqp, cassandra, mysql, postgresq,
       thrift-rpc, mongodb, memcache, tls)
    .. correlates requests with responses
. Heartbeat
    .. pings via icmp, tcp and http
    .. supports tls, authentication and proxies
    .. simple dns resolution
. Winlogbeat
    .. attach to windows event log channels
. Auditbeat
    .. auditd module:
        ... linux only
        ... attaches to linux kernel's audit framework
        ... combines multiple audit messages into a single event
        ... configure what syscalls to monitor
    .. file integrity module:
        ... compatible with linux, macos, windows
        ... hashes specified files and monitors changes in real-time
        ... compare to known malicious file hashes

Libbeat - common library, foundation of every beat

=== Logstash

Designed for log processing.

Data pipelines:

. inputs - ingest from multiple sources
. filters - parse events into structured fields, enrich events dynamically.
. outputs - stash the processed events, output to multiple destinations

=== Elasticsearch

. the heart of the elastic stack
. distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine
. highly scalable adn fault tolerant
. near real time (NRT)
. common use cases:
    .. product search with autocomplete for websites
    .. mine log or transaction data for trends, statisticts or anomalies
    .. quickly investigate, analyze, visualize, and ask ad-hoc questions on huge datasets

==== Important terms

. Cluster
    .. collection of one or more nodes
    .. federated searching and indexing across all nodes
    .. identified by unique name
. Node
    .. single server in the cluster
    .. identified by name
. Index
    .. collection of documents
. Document
    .. basic unit of information
    .. expressed in JSON
. Shard
    .. piece of an index
    .. horizontally splits an index for scalability
    .. replication via replica shards:
        ... replicas are never allocated on the same node
            as the primary shard
        ... allows for fault tollerance
        ... scale search throughoutput

==== Cluster states

. Green:
    .. all primary shards are allocated
    .. all replica shards are allocated
. Yellow:
    .. all primary shards are allocated
    .. one or more replicas are unallocated
. Red:
    .. one or more primary shards are unallocated

==== Node types

. Master-Eligible Node:
    .. Responsible for cluster management:
        ... Creating/deleting indexes
        ... Tracking cluster members
        ... Shard allocation
. Data Node:
    .. contains shards
    .. handles CRUD, search and aggregation operations
. Ingest Node:
    .. Executes pre-processing pipelines
. Coordinating-Only Node:
    .. smart load balancer:
        ... routes requests
        ... handles search deducing
        ... distributes bulk indexing
. Machine Learning Node:
    .. X-Pack machine learning plugin
    .. runs machine learning jobs
    .. handles machine learning API requests

==== Best practices

. dedicated nodes for each role
. data node sizing:
    .. 32GB max heap
    .. at least as much free memory as heap memory
    .. solid-state drives
    .. more cores are always better than faster clock speeds
. search and index against coordinating-only nodes
. size to YOUR use case:
    .. load test yoru specific use case and make sizing adjustments
       as necessary
    .. every use case has its own requirements
    .. there is no one-size-fits-all elasticsearch cluster

=== Kibana

. search, view and interact with data stored in elasticsearch
. discover:
    .. interactively explore data
    .. search and filter the data to view specific documents
    .. save searches for quick use later or to embed in dashboards
. visualize:
    .. visual representation of the data
    .. create dashboards
    .. charts, data tables, markdown, gauges, maps and more
. Timelion:
    .. Time series data visualizer
    .. Simple expression language
. Dev tools:
    .. console
        ... UI to interact with the REST API
    .. profiler
        ... visualize API
        ... inspect and analyze seach queries
        ... debug and diagnese performance issues
    .. Grok Debugger:
        ... build and debug grok patterns
        ... same grok implementation as ingest node and Logstash
. Management:
    .. configure index patterns to connect ES indexes to Kibana
    .. manage fields by adding intelligent formatting
    .. configure advanced Kibana options
    .. manage saved searches, visualisations and dashboards

=== X-Pack

Needs license.

Plugins:

. Security:
    .. Active Directory, LDAP, and SAML authentication
    .. manage user and roles
    .. entcrypt cluster communication with SSL/TSL
    .. index, document and even field level restriction
    .. audit log
. Alerting:
    .. identify and alert on changes in the data
    .. notifications by email, PagerDuty, Slack, HipChat or
       webhook
. Monitoring:
    .. track ES performance and usage at the cluster,
       node and index level
    .. track Kibana usage and request performance
    .. monitor Logstash throughput and pipeline performance
    .. multi-stack support to centralize ES monitoring
. Reporting:
    .. generate, schedule and share reports
    .. export raw documents, searches, visualizations
       and whole dashboards
    .. send reports on a schedule or trigger a report
       when certain conditions are met
. Graph:
    .. discover relations in the data
    .. integrate with your apps using the API
    .. visualize in Kibana
    .. filter relevant relationships from popular ones
. Machine Learning:
    .. unsupervised anomaly detection
    .. visualize and analyze anormalies quickly
    .. prepare for the future with on-demand forecasting
    .. intuitive UI for easy job creation
