Tools for software analysis:

* eclipse - xray
* jdepend
* nDepend
* code crawler

Microservices - frontends
* BFF - Backends for frontend
* micro-front ends

Service based architectures as comparing to microservices:
- Larger service granularity
- database scope
- use of a service bus as integration hub

Building Evolutionary Architectures - book

fitness function?

Evolutionary architecture:

* guided
* inctermental
* multiple dimensions

Use jdepend!!!

== Presentation "Architecture by Example"

by Neal Ford and Mark Richards

2018-11-14

Everything is a trade off.

Architecture characteristics:

* reliability
* scalability
* performance
* availability

* feasibility
* agility
* elasticity
* scalability

Auction house example:

Core aspects:

* availability
* reliability
* performance
* scalability
* elasticity

Architecture mostly adresses non-functional requirements.


Sandwich service:

* performance
* availability
* reliability
* scalability
* elasticity
* i18n
* l10n
* customizability:
    ** location
    ** sales
    ** recipe

zero downtime - catch phrase

Primary vs secondary architectural characteristics

Building evolutionary architectures

* evolvability - when system changes over time, the performance
  do not degrade
* governance -

Evolutionary architecture - supports guided,
incremental change across multiple dimensions.

evolutionary computing fitness function::
  a particular type of objective punction that is used to summarize how close


architectural fitness function::
    provides

incremental changes

cyclomatic complexity
naming conventinos
Postel's Law
conctrolled afferent/efferent coupling

crap4j - java library measuring cyclomatic complexity

Components

Compontent::
    building block of the application well defined
    set of operations well defined role and responsibility

Steps:

. identify initial core components
. repeat:
    .. assign user stories to components
    .. analyze roles and responsibility statements
    .. analyze non-functional aspects
    .. refactor components as needed

place orders
fullfil orders
ship orders

user story: check inventory

Components:

* order placement
* order fullfilment
* order shipping

Worflow approach:

create auction -> find auction -> sign up -> watch auction ->
place bid

Actor/action approach:

We take actors (bidder, auctioneer, system).

What does the bidder do? view live video stream,

=== Architectural patterns and styles

architectural quantum::
    an architectual quantum is an independently
    deployable component with high
    functional cohesion, which includes all the
    structural elements required for the system to function
    properly.

architecture patterns:

* microservices architecture
* service-based architecture
* layered architecture
* event-driven architecture
* pipeline architecture
* microkernel architecture
* space-based architecture

==== Microservices architecture

clients, api layer, service components

no choreography

single service captures a bounded context

User interface options:

* monolithic UI
* partitioned UI
* micro front-ends

Drivers for microservices:

* modularity
* agility
* fault-tolerance
* scalability
* testability
* deployability
* evolvability

Side-car component:

==== Service based architecture

Pragmatic nature

Looks a little like microservices.

Client requests go into user interface layer.

Several service components.

Components share database.

Drivers:

* modularity
* agility
* fault-tolerance
* scalability
* testability
* deployability
* simplicity / cost
* evolvability

==== Monolith

Layered architecture:

* presentation layer
* business layer
* services layer
* persistence layer
* database rayel.

Drivers:

* simplicity
* cost

Two flawors of monoliths:

* layered architecture - technical partitioning
* modular monolith - domain partitioning

==== Event-driven architecture

. Broker topology

. Mediator topology

==== Pipeline architecture

==== Microkernel architecture

==== Space-based architecturce

Solves elasticity and extreme scalability.

* processing units
    ** contain cached memory
* virtualized middleware

* context diagram
* container diagram
* component diagram
* class diagram

=== Architecture Decision Records

Title::
    short noun phrase

Context::
    forces at play

Decision:
    response to forces

Status::
    proposed, accepted, superseded

Consequences::
    context after decision is applied


Factors:

* cost?
* impacts other teams?
* impacts security?

== Messaging

=== Request/reply messaging

* request queue
* reply queue

Request/reply pattern techniques:

. using correlation id: correlation id
  is used to identify responses.
. using temporary queues: the message contains temporary
  queue name

=== Kafka vs standard messaging

Standard messaging: ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ

[options="header",cols=",a,a"]
|===========
|           |Kafka                  | Standard messaging
|payload
|very small key-value pairs of atomic values
|very large payloads

|data flow
|unbounded continous flow of data
|distinct bounded message

|throughput
|up to 1 million messages/sec
|up to 4k/10k messages/sec

|purpose
|operational data (metrics, audit, logging)
|transactional data (for example: placing an order)

|topology
|only pub/sub
|
three options:

* point-to-point (queues)
* pub/sub
* exchange (AMQP)

|===========

Payloads: typically key-value pairs of atomic string.
