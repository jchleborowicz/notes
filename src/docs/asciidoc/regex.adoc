Back referencing:

* \0 - full matched text
* \1 - first group
* \2 - second group
* etc.

Literal matching:

`\Q...\S` - everything between \Q and \S is matched literally.

== Line breaks

`\R` - matches CR, LF and CRLF

== Regex engines

Kinds:

* text-directed
* regex-directed - based on backtracing:
    ** lazy qualifiers
    ** backreferences
    ** atomic grouping
    ** possessive qualifiers

== Character classes

`[A-Za-z_0-9]`

`[^A-Za-z_0-9]` - matches line break characters

Metacharacters inside a character class: `]`, `\`, `^`, `-`

=== Character class intersection

`[a-z&&[^aeiou]]` - any letter that is not a vowel

=== Shorthand character classes

`\d` - digits
`\w` - matches `[A-Za-z0-9_]`
`\s` - matches `[ \t\r\n\f]`

== Anchors

`^` - beginning of the line
`$` - end of the line
